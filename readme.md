# Task

The task was to calculate the definite integral of the function ( f(x) = x^2 ) in the interval from ( 0 ) to ( 2 ) using the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method relies on random sampling and is a stochastic approach to estimate the area under a curve.

# Conclusions

The result obtained via the Monte Carlo method ((2.67)) closely aligns with the result given by the quad function ((2.666)). This comparison demonstrates the feasibility of using the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of a definite integral, providing relatively accurate results. However, the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method is contingent upon the number of random points sampled; increasing the number of points can lead to higher accuracy.

Given the extremely low error estimate provided by the quad function, analytical or numerical integration methods offer more precise results and computational reliability. Nonetheless, the Monte Carlo method presents a viable alternative, especially in scenarios where traditional methods are impractical, like with high-dimensional integral problems.

In summary, both methods serve valid and useful purposes in computation. Comparing the flexibility and general applicability of the Monte Carlo method against the high precision and low error offered by the quad function is intriguing. This juxtaposition highlights the importance and applicability of varied approaches to solving mathematical problems.
